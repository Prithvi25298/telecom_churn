# Telecom Churn Case Study Hackathon
> In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.

In this competition, your goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.


## Table of Contents
* Predict churning customers for a Telecom company based on temporal behaviour
* Python (#technologies-used)
* I create two models PCA + Logistic Regression and Decision Tree In this Case Decision Tree has a 91% accurate on both Test and Train Data(#conclusions)

<!-- You can include any other section that is pertinent to your problem -->

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Accuracy Score of Random Forest is 91%
- 55 columns are best fit to model According to PCA

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
