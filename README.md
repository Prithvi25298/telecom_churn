# Predict click through rate ctr for a website
> The problem of interest is the prediction of the apply rate. Imagine a user visiting a website, and performing a job search. From the set of displayed results, user clicks on certain ones that she is interested in, and after checking job descriptions, she further clicks on apply button therein to land in to an application page. The apply rate is defined as the fraction of applies (after visiting job description pages), and the goal is to predict this metric using the dataset described in the following section.


## Table of Contents
